You may live in fools' paradise several times for some affections for someone who never deserves these. But when you finally realize your stupid racks, you have to move on. Otherwise, you're a moron. At this time, your real near and dear ones are by your side as they were.
<br>
<br>
No one is perfect! No one is complete! You never know who is the actual right person for you except the Almighty. If you can claim the heavenly affection for someone, you should be able to leave no stone unturned to fulfill each other till your death. There will be no excuses until you are the hypocrite with these divine affections!
